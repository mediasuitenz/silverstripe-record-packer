/**
 * Covers RelationSchema::ownedManyManyRelations()'s handling of `many_many_through` relations
 * specifically. The module deliberately doesn't support round-tripping a through join's own
 * content (see that method's own doc comment) — but an EXCLUDED target class must still be
 * skipped silently, exactly like any other excluded relation, rather than reported as an
 * unconditional failure regardless of what the relation actually points at. This matters because
 * a project may exclude a class for precisely the reason it reached for `through` in the first
 * place — e.g. real per-environment transactional data with its own workflow-status field on the
 * join row (see `Service::$many_many['Applications']`/`ApplicationService` in the marketplace
 * app, which is exactly this shape).
