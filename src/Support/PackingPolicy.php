 * constructor-supplied collaborator rather than hard-coded, so the two extension classes serve
 * both cases without a SiteTree-specific subclass of either.
 *
 * Two implementations ship: {@see RecordPackingPolicy} (the default, for any project DataObject)
 * and {@see SiteTreePackingPolicy} (for `SiteTree`, wired up as a named Injector service variant
 * in this module's own `_config/extensions.yml` — the same pattern
 * `silverstripe/versioned`'s own `Versioned` extension uses for its Stage/StagedVersioned modes:
 * one extension class, two named `Injector` service variants with different constructor args,
 * and a default alias).
