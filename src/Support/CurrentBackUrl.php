 * Captures "the URL actually being viewed right now" as an absolute URL — used to populate the

 * Export/Import modal forms at the moment those forms are built (during the record's own edit
 * form/GridField render), rather than relying on the later form-submission request's `Referer`
 * header. A `Referrer-Policy`, browser privacy setting, or extension can omit or strip that
 * header on an otherwise ordinary same-origin form POST, which — before this existed — silently
 * sent every export/import back to the site root instead of back into the CMS.
